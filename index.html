      <h3>Mathematics</h3>
      <p>As part of <a href="https://www.umsl.edu/mathcs/undergraduate-studies/BS-cs.html">UMSL's B.S. in Computer Science program</a>, I have taken College Algebra, Trigonometry, Calulus I and II, Statistics, Linear Algebra and Discrete Structure. I enjoy Math, and its connection to Computer Science.</p>
      <p>As a Teacher's Assistant in UMSL's Mathematics department, I have the oppertunity to help other people learn new math skills and share my passion for learning. </p>

      <h3>Computer Science</h3>
      <p>The first programming languages I learned were <strong>C and C++</strong>.  I learned programming techniques, and became familiar with the wonderful world of <a href="https://xkcd.com/138/">pointers.</a>  Next I learned to develop applications in <strong>Java and JavaFX.</strong>  My favorite was writing my own Minesweeper application.  You can check the code for it out on GitHub <a href="thetotaljim.github.io/MySweeper.java">here.</a></p>
      <p>I learned systems programming in <strong>UNIX</strong>, as well as how to write <strong>Bash scripts.</strong>  I really enjoyed studying Web Design, especially designing this page.  I learned <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and MySQL.</strong> Lastly, I studied Computer Networking, where I designed a Server/Client application that accessed data from several MySQL databases.</p>
